The fictitious Indian philosopher Abhay Urjavaha Revati was born on January 3, 1924 at 4:00 PM, in Aranasi, a town in the Nagpur province of India.  His father, Mr Krupali Setar, a theologian of some repute, together with his mother, Mrs. Sushanti Singh, worked at the Central Bank of India.  Abhay was the vice-president of the United Humanist Philosophers Association, which is located in  Thiruvananthapuram.

He married his wife Madam Savita Narvas on Dec. 5th, 1957 in Mumbai. They had several children together, all of whom where born in Southeast Asia, with the exception of their youngest daughter Kishana who was born in Boston, Massachusetts.

Abhay's Hindu background, the influence of his parents, and his favorite teacher, Professor Sungul Kahani all contributed to his great work in religious philosophy.

His daughter Kishana took two years off from work to dedicate a memorial website to her father. She posted on the website a lot of pictures of her late father driving his Honda Civic, which she took with her Nikon D5100 camera. The website ( www.revati.com ) raised over $5 million for children's hospitals across the country. About one million went to  Deodhar Children's Hospital.
